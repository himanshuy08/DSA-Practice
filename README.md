# DSA Practice in C++

This repository contains my practice code for Data Structures and Algorithms using C++.  
Each topic is implemented in C++ and organized into separate folders like LinkedList, Array, Stack, etc.

## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run

Use a C++ compiler like `g++` to compile and run any file:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
